* My Emacs configs

** Keybindings
My keybindings are based on vanilla Emacs, with modifications mainly considering frequencies of usage(the statistics is
obtained with the [[https://github.com/dacap/keyfreq][keyfreq]] package).

I made =C-z= a global prefix key, since I don't use the =suspend-frame= function bound to =C-z= in vanilla Emacs at all, and
it locates near the other two major prefix keys(=C-x= and =C-c=).

The following is a list of my most frequently used functionalities and their keybindings.
